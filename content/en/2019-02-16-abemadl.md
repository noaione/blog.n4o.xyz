This guidelines/tutorial will use the program called `yuu` that I made

:repo-card{username="noaione" repo="yuu"}

::admonition{type="note" title="Note"}
The command in all of the image are outdated, you need to add the keyword `download` after `yuu` on the latest version.

::admonition{type="warning" title="Warning"}
Yuu is no longer supported by me, and the GitHub repo has been archived.

What you need:

- Python 3.6+
- FFMpeg (Optional)
- Japan Proxy or VPN

**Please install Python 3.6+ first, you can follow this tutorial: https://xo.tc/installing-python-36-on-windows.html**

**FFMPEG**

1. Download it from here: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z
2. Extract the downloaded file, and copy the `ffmpeg.exe` from the `bin` folder to `C:\Windows`

## Preparation

After you finish installing Python and downloading and extracting ffmpeg, open CMD or Powershell and use `cd` to move into another directory.

Another easy way is to `SHIFT-Right Click` on a folder, and click `Open PowerShell window here` or `Open Command Prompt window here`

Type `pip install -U yuu` then wait until it finish installing.

If there's an error like `requests not found` or something like that, manually install the dependencies by writing:

```bash
pip install requests[socks] tqdm pycryptodome m3u8
```

Then install `yuu` again.

After `yuu` is installed, start by typing `yuu -h` and make sure it show something like this:

!["yuu -h"](/assets/images/abemadl/03.png)

## Downloading

Now, activate a Japanese VPN or have a Proxy that you want to use.<br />
If you use proxy, I recommend a HTTPS proxy or something like that.

```bash
$ yuu -h
Usage: yuu [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A simple AbemaTV and other we(e)bsite video downloader

Options:
  -V, --version  Show current version
  -h, --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  download  Download a video from yuu Supported we(e)bsite
  streams   Check supported website
```

To start downloading, you can type

```bash
> yuu download https://abema.tv/video/episode/54-25_s1_p1
```

This will start downloading Episode 1 of Yagate Kimi ni Naru.
If you use Proxy, add this parameter `-p ip:port`

To select resolution, use `-r` like `-r 720p` (Available resolution usually are: 180p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p)<br />
You can do `yuu download -R https://abema.tv/video/episode/54-25_s1_p1` to check what resolution is available

![Download success](/assets/images/abemadl/04b.png)
![Download result](/assets/images/abemadl/04c.png)

The downloaded file now can be muxed into mkv using mkvtoolnix or ffmpeg

If there's an error while muxing, you can type this command:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.ts -map 0:0 -map 0:1 -c copy output-fix.ts
```

Change `input.ts` to your input file and `output-fix.ts` to anything you want.
