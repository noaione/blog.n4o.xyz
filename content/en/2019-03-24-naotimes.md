## Information

naoTimes is a multi-function Bot with the main language of Indonesian that took inspiration from Aquarius Bot that are used in GJM and DDY Discord.

This bot is created at March 21, 2019 because me being bored in my family places, so I decide to just open my laptop that I bring and start writing ideas on how the main feature should work.

This bot has evolved through many iteration and the I'm happy with the current version :)

## naoTimesUI

naoTimesUI is a WebUI that the user/server admin can use to configure Showtimes feature from the interwebs.

The website itself support:

- 👀 See all projects in nice design

- ✏ Change episode status easily
- 👯‍♂️ Change staff on a project (Still need to get Discord User ID)

- 💬 Change the #announcement channel for project
- 🎩 Add/Remove Showtimes Admin for your Server

With the public release of this website, now people can register for the Showtimes feature easily without needing to ask me.<br />
