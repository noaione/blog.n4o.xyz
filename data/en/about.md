Hello, my (nick)name is N4O. A junior software developer from Indonesia that also love Japanese relateed media. In my free time, I usually just do some random stuff like gaming, reading manga/novel, and sometimes do some coding here and there.

Another thing I usually do is develop my Bot [naoTimes](https://naoti.me). A multi-function Discord Bot with the main feature is track Fansub project progress (Only available in Indonesian Language)`

You can usually find me at Discord: **@noaione**<br />
Or you can contact me via another social media!
